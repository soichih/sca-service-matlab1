[TOC]

## Overview


[MATLAB's Optimization Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization/) tackles wide variety of solvers such as linear programming, mixed-integer linear programming, quadratic programming, nonlinear optimization. In this tutorial, we learn how to use simulated annealing to find the minimum of a function. The test function is the well known Rosenbrock function.

## Tutorial files

It is easiest to start with the `tutorial` command. In the command prompt, type
	 $ tutorial tutorial-matlab-SimulatedAnnealing # Copies input and script files to the directory tutorial-matlab-SimulatedAnnealing.
 
This will create a directory `tutorial-matlab-SimulatedAnnealing`. Inside the directory, you will see the following files

    SA_Opt.m               # matlab script - simulated annealing optimization of the function `simple_objective.m`
    simple_objective.m     # matlab script - defines the actual objective function
    SA_Opt                 # matlab compiled binary
    SA_Opt.submit          # Condor job description file
    run_SA_Opt.sh          # Executable file
    Log/                   # Directory to copy standard output, error and log files from condor jobs.


## MATLAB script -  Objective function

Lets take a look at the objective function that takes an argument of an array x. The size of the array is two.

    function y = simple_objective(x)
         y = (1-x(1))^2 + 100*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2;

The objective function is defined in the matlab file `simple_objective.m`. 

## MATLAB script - Optimization
The simulated annealing script calls the objective function and optimizes via `simulannealbnd`. 

    %Simulated Annealing optimization of a given function
    function SA_Optimization(fnumber)
        filenumber = num2str(fnumber);
        outfilename = sprintf ( '%s%s%s', 'rosen-sa-opt', filenumber, '.dat' );
        fileID = fopen(outfilename,'w');

        ObjectiveFunction = @simple_objective;
        rng('shuffle');
        for n = 1:1:5
            rx = rand(1:2)*100.0;
            X0 = [2.0 2.0] + rx;   % Starting point
            [x,fval,exitFlag,output] = simulannealbnd(ObjectiveFunction,X0) %
            fprintf(fileID,'f= %12.6f  x= %9.5f   y= %9.5f x0= %9.5f  y0=%9.5f\n', fval, x, X0 );
        end
        fclose(fileID);

In the above script, the optimizatoin is repeated for five times with a random intial condition. 

## MATLAB runtime execution

As mentioned in the previous section (link here), we need to compile the matlab script on a machine with license. At present, we don't have license for matlab on OSG conect.  On a machine with matlab license, invoke the compiler `mcc`. We turn off all graphical options (-nodisplay), disable Java (-nojvm), and instruct MATLAB to run this program as a single-threaded application (-singleCompThread). The flag -m means `c` language translation during compilation. 

    mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm SA_Opt.m

would produce the files: matrix, run_SA_Opt.sh, mccExcludedFiles.log and readme.txt files.  The file `SA_Opt` is the compiled binary file. "run_SA_Opt.sh" is the script file that executes the binary. 

## Job execution and submission files

Let us take a look at `SA_Opt.submit` file: 


    Universe = vanilla                          # One OSG Connect vanilla, the prefered job universe is "vanilla"

    Executable =  run_SA_Opt.sh    # Job execution file which is transfered to worker machine
    Arguments = "/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2014b/v84/ $(Process) "   # list of arguments: (1) path of matlab runtime libraries.  (2) process ID. 
    transfer_input_files = SA_Opt               # list of file(s) need be transfered to the remote worker machine 

    Output = Log/job.$(Process).outâ‹…            # standard ouput 
    Error =  Log/job.$(Process).err             # standard error
    Log =    Log/job.$(Process).log             # log information about job execution

    requirements = HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= True   # Check if the worker machine has CVMFS 

    queue 10                                   # Submit 10  jobs


## Job submision 

We submit the job using `condor_submit` command as follows

	$ condor_submit SA_Opt.submit //Submit the condor job description file "SA_Opt.submit"

Now you have submitted the an ensemble of 10 jobs. The jobs should be finished quickly (less than an hour). You can check the status of the submitted job by using the `condor_q` command as follows

	$ condor_q username  # The status of the job is printed on the screen. Here, username is your login name.


Each job produce rosen-sa-opt$(Process).dat file, where $(Process) is the process ID that runs from 0 to 9.
